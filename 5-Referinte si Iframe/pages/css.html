    <p>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
        separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its
        presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
        multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
        load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
